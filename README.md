## Features

This demo is written in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. It has no dependencies. The line-drawings are stored as a gray scale and compressed to webp format that is supported by major browsers. The navigation buttons are svg graphics. The audio text is hidden by the css tag "display: none;". The default voice is selected for Android but had to be hard coded for Apple devices.
